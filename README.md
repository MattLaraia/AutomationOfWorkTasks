# AutomationOfWorkTasks
The first application automatically logs a new user into the system (main file of all patients) and creates a personal file for them in the specified directory.

TODO:
First program working but the option to change the directory to place patients has not been implemented
Make a second application that can compare/remove patient visit dates on the main sheets if shown they have been paid on the personal sheets.
